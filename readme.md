# RootMetrics Chart Maker 

After pulling the repo, run "npm install" and "bower install" from Terminal in the "chart-maker" directory, to install needed dependencies and JS libraries. 

### Grunt
To compile and minify your LESS, run "grunt less" from Terminal. To concat and minify your JS files, run "grunt uglify". To do a "live watch" to enable these calls to run in the background, run 
"grunt watch", which will run both of these functions anytime you save a LESS or JS file.
